# Gemini AI Code Examples 🤖

This repository contains Python code examples demonstrating how to interact with the Gemini AI model. It's designed to help you get started quickly and explore the capabilities of Gemini.

## 🚀 Getting Started

These examples are primarily written in Python and require a few steps to set up:

1. **Prerequisites:**

   - Python 3.8 or higher is recommended. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
   - Ensure you have `pip` installed. It usually comes with Python. You can check by running `pip --version` in your terminal.
   - You'll need a Google Cloud Project with the Vertex AI API enabled. If you don't have one already, follow the instructions on the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/). You may also need to enable the Generative AI API.

2. **Installation:**

   - Clone this repository:
     ```bash
     git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/gemini-ai-examples.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/gemini-ai-examples.git) # Replace with your repo URL
     cd gemini-ai-examples
     ```

   - Create a virtual environment (recommended):
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv .venv  # Create the environment
     source .venv/bin/activate  # Activate on Linux/macOS
     .venv\Scripts\activate  # Activate on Windows
     ```

   - Install the necessary Python packages:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt # See the requirements.txt file for dependencies
     ```
     *(You'll need to create a `requirements.txt` file listing all the Python packages your code uses. Example contents: `google-cloud-aiplatform`)*

3. **Authentication:**

   - Set up authentication with Google Cloud. The easiest way is usually to set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path of your service account key file. You can download a service account key from the Google Cloud Console (IAM & Admin -> Service Accounts).
     ```bash
     export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/service_account_key.json" # Linux/macOS
     set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="C:\path\to\your\service_account_key.json"  # Windows
     ```

4. **Running the Examples:**

   - Navigate to the directory containing the example you want to run (e.g., `GeminiAI-APICall`).
   - Execute the Python script (the specific script name might vary depending on your example):
     ```bash
     python your_script_name.py  # Replace your_script_name.py with the actual script name.
     ```

## 📝 Examples

This repository contains examples for interacting with the Gemini AI model, including:

- **`GeminiAI-APICall`:** Demonstrates how to make direct API calls to Gemini for various tasks (e.g., text generation, embeddings).  *(Provide a brief description of what this example does)*
- **`GeminiAI-ChatBot`:** Shows how to build a simple chatbot using Gemini. *(Provide a brief description of what this example does)*

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please open an issue or submit a pull request if you have any suggestions or improvements.

## 💡 Tips and Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any errors related to authentication, double-check that your service account key file is valid and that the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable is set correctly.
- Make sure you have the necessary APIs enabled in your Google Cloud project.
- Refer to the [Gemini AI documentation](https://developers.generativeai.google/) for more information. *(Replace with actual Gemini docs link when available)*
